	## Photography!
	
	I'm not very good at creative stuff, but I would say I am decent at taking photos.
	
	There are many things I like to photograph, mainly landscape, cities, and airplanes!

	I'll showcase some here eventually...

	## Airplanes!

	I think aviation is pretty cool. The idea of being able to travel freely, far far away always interested me, in my free time, I like to fly around England in a [flight simulator](https://www.geo-fs.com).

	Maybe one day I will train for a Private Pilot License, maybe.

	## Electronics

	I'm not the best at coding, but I am pretty good at making electronics, I love designing circuit boards and assembling them, it's just like lego but more advanced :p

	I'm also pretty good at soldering, I'd say most of my joints are perfect!

	I've also soldered a few (4) 01005 resistors which in my opinion is quite impressive, for context, each resistor is about 0.2mm wide, which is just about the size of a grain of fine table salt!

	## Radio and RF

	I have been interested in RF for quite a while, I remeber when I bought a [software-defined radio dongle](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-mini.html) and started tracking aircrafts via ADS-B and Mode-S, I had so much fun just learning about radio frequencies. This wasn't something I thought I would be interested in but I am so glad I discovered it.

	I also learned about receving NOAA satellite images, particularlly the NOAA-15/18/19 satellites that transmits [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission) on 137MHz, I remember using a handheld radio and just recording the beeps of the APT signal, then later decoding them on SatDump.

	I didn't get many good quality images from it before they were decomissioned but here's my favourite one.

	## Music!

	When I'm not taking photos, or flying, or tinkering, I like to listen to music (or while doing those things), I listen to a lot of stuff, my statistics says I listen to a lot of Green Day, Coldplay and Avicii.

	Here are some Spotify playlists I made:
	
	- [Some music that I think goes together](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5KMuRg3aa3kvPZACycmiAM)

	## Other things!

	I don't really like doing game-sports, although I do like hiking, rock climbing, and much more.

	I quite like cooking, or things that I can see the results of my work!

	Another interesting fact about me is that I have citizenship in 2 countries, which is neat!

	Btw, most if not all of my projects are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/krunchiekrunch), because where else would I store them :>

	And as always, feel free to shoot me an email or direct message me anytime, anywhere, and for any reason :)
