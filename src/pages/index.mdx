	## Photography!
	
	I'm not very good at creative stuff, but I would say I am decent at taking photos.
	
	There are many things I like to photograph, mainly landscape, cities, and airplanes!

	I'll showcase some here eventually...

	## Aviation!

	I think aviation is pretty cool. The idea of being able to travel freely, far far away always interested me, in my free time, I like to fly around England in a [flight simulator](https://www.geo-fs.com).

	## Electronics

	I'm not the best at coding, but I am pretty good at making electronics, I love designing circuit boards and assembling them, it's just like lego but more advanced :p

	I'm also pretty good at soldering, I'd say most of my joints are perfect!

	I've also soldered a few (4) 01005 resistors which in my opinion is quite impressive, for context, each resistor is about 0.2mm wide, which is just about the size of a grain of fine table salt!

	## Radio and RF

	I have been interested in RF for quite a while, I remeber when I bought a [software-defined radio dongle](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-mini.html) and started tracking aircrafts via ADS-B and Mode-S, I had so much fun just learning about radio frequencies. This wasn't something I thought I would be interested in but I am so glad I discovered it.

	I also learned about receving NOAA satellite images, particularlly the NOAA-15/18/19 satellites that transmits [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission) on 137MHz, I remember using a handheld radio and just recording the beeps of the APT signal, then later decoding them on SatDump.

	I didn't get many good quality images from it before they were decomissioned but here's my favourite one.

	<img src='/photos/noaaapt.png' alt='A image of Europe received from NOAA APT transmission' width='909' height='969' loading='lazy' style='width: min(300px, 100%); margin-top: 60px;' />

	## Music!

	When I'm not taking photos, or flying, or tinkering, I like to listen to music (or while doing those things), I listen to many things across multiple genres!

	Here's a collection of music I quite like:
	
	- [Some music that I think are pretty good](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5KMuRg3aa3kvPZACycmiAM)

	<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5KMuRg3aa3kvPZACycmiAM?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
	
	## Other things!

	I don't really like doing game-sports, although I do like hiking, rock climbing, and much more.

	I quite like cooking, or things that I can see the results of my work!

	Over the course of my life, I've set foot on 10 countries, those being (in alphabetical order): China, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vatican City.

	Btw, most if not all of my projects are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/krunchiekrunch), because where else would I store them :>

	And as always, feel free to shoot me an email or direct message me anytime, anywhere, and for any reason :)
